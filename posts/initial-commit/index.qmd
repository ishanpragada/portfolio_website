Winter break started recently and I decided to revamp my website.[^reason] As I write this, I'm not even finished with some of the sections, but I wanted to use this as a space to remind myself how to do things in [Quarto](quarto.org). 


[^reason]: My hand was forced after people reached out still thinking I was a junior in _high school_.

## Why Quarto?

Quarto is pretty similar to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), but it's got [elegant cross-referencing](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html), [multi-language support](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/), and [multiple column integration](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#complex-layouts).[^not-important] However, the main caveat with all these features is that I will inevitably forget how to code something, which is why this post exists. If you're curious, you can click on the ``</> Code`` button in the top right to see the source code of the post.

[^not-important]: Okay the last one is not as important, but it was such a pain in Markdown.

## Layouts

Quarto layouts are easily customizable, especially with figures:

::: {layout='[[1,1,1],[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]'}

## Computations

Here's how to change the blog layout into two columns. I also used this space to showcase some computations in Quarto.

::: {.flex-container style="width: 100%; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start;"}

::: {.column style="width: 30%;"}

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

::: {.column style="width: 70%"}

## `Python (matplotlib.pyplot)` {style="text-align:center;"}

::: {style="text-align:left;"}
```python
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
