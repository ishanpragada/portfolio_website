## Disclaimer: I'm new to this.

Winter break started recently and I decided to revamp my website.[^reason] As I write this, I'm not even finished with some of the sections, but I wanted to use this as a space to remind myself how to do things in [Quarto](quarto.org). 


[^reason]: My hand was forced after people reached out still thinking I was a junior in _high school_.

## Why Quarto?

Quarto is pretty similar to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), but it's got [elegant cross-referencing](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html), [multi-language support](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/), and [multiple column integration](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#complex-layouts).[^not-important]

[^not-important]: Okay the last one is not as important, but it was such a pain in Markdown.
